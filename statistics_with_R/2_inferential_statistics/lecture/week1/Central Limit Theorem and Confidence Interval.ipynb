    "- We call this distribution the sampling distribution. The mean of the sample means will probably be around the true population. Roughly 65 inches as well. The standard deviation of this sample means, we'll probably be much lower than the population standard deviation since we would expect the average height for each state to be pretty close to one another. For example, we wouldn't expect to find s state where the average height of a random sample of thousand women is as low as 4 feet or as high as 7 feet. We call the standard deviation of the sample means the standard error. \n",
    "- In fact as the sample size N increases, the standard error will decrease. The fewer woman with sample from each state, the more variable we would expect the sample means to be. "
